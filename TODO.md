### Blocking Demo Release

 - [x] Fix bottom wall to be within stage bounds

 - [x] Add callbacks to know who 'scored'
 - [x] Display scores on screen
 - [x] Make computer able to control both players for demo function
 - [x] Add start screen utilising demo
 - [x] Fix texture scaling as it is ugly in full screen
 - [x] Add some kind of world decoration to make less boring
 - [x] Add obstacles
 - [x] Add SegmentShape to physics2d
 - [x] Restore accumulator for now in physics2d
 - [x] Add background music (`serpent-audio`)
 - [x] Add impact SFX for walls and paddles (`serpent-audio`)
 - [ ] Fix collision shape on paddles (no slop overlap or offset)
 - [ ] Huge cleanup to make it feel more game-like

### Could Be Nice

 - [ ] Potentially add powerups (multiple ball spawn)
 - [ ] Add sprite rotation so ball rotates with physics correctly
 - [ ] Add drawing code to chipmunk (primitives) so we can *visualise* the physics, man.
